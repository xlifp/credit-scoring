Predicting Default Risk of Lending Club Loans
First step is to clean and pre-process your dataset.   
Apply several well-known classification ML algorithms to the dataset and analyse their performance using typical performance measures. 
Try to interpret the outcomes of your ML algorithm (no need to do it for all applied methods, choose one, e.g., the best performing one) and compare the interpretation to the one from logistic regression.  
Apply fairness tests and do bias mitigation, just assess whether there are biases in the data and outcomes with respect to the protected attributes.
